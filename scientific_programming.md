#### The paper describes several problems scientist face when performing scientific data analyses. From your experience in performing GIS and general data analyses, which of these problems seem familiar to you? Have you faced other problems not mentioned in the paper? (~100 words)

For me as a computer scientist it is very easy to write prototyping code and to show some quick results 
on smaller analysis. As I am always the person, who is doing the programming job, the most challenging part
is to understand the task and the requirements. 

After prototyping, the next challenging part is to write maintainable code
that does not need to be retyped after some requirements changed. 
I haven't had any bigger Geoscripting projects yet. So I can't say that I
am able to write maintainable scripting code.

#### Which methods described in the paper or which other skills, tools etc. would you like to learn to help you avoid these problems in the future?

Since I am working on larger programming projects for four years, I would
like to get into the way of commenting my project in a better way. 
Abstract coding is something very new for scientists and also computer scientists sometimes.
I often realise that I write a lot of code which is working fine, but my 
workmates are asking a lot of questions because it is to complex and not described.

#### One of the recommendations by Wilson et al. (2014) for scientists is to use a Version Control System (VCS). Briefly explain in your own words, what the benefits of VCS are in the context of scientific analyses

A Version Control System is one of the most important tools for programming.
It enables to work in groups on the same project and saves each individual state
(commit) of the software. It is possible to work in branches where the main code
will not be touched. So you can do some prototyping analysis on a different branch
and handle multiple states from the software. Afterwards you can merge the different states
to the main project (master).
